Multiple computers do processes that in the end create more bitcoin, kind of like printing money. Because bitcoin has value it sort of turns the energy used in to creating it to a currency. In the end of article was mentioned a new process that wouldn't consume as much energy as the current one, which sounds much more better to me."
